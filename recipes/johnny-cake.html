    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
    <p>Breakfast johnny cakes are delicious when split and buttered immediately. Smaller cakes, filled with cream cheese, may be served at tea time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp. baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp. butter</li>
        <li>1/3 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tsp. sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift 2 cups of flour before measuring</li>
        <li>Re-sift it with 2 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. salt.</li>
        <li>Using two knives or a pastry blender, cut 2 tsp of butter into the flour</li>
        <li>Combine 1/3 cup water and 2 tsp. sugar and stir until the sugar is dissolved</li>
        <li>To make the dough, add the liquid a little at a time to the flour.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead it well.</li>
        <li>Pinch off pieces, roll them into small balls and flatten into circles two inches in diameter and one-fourth inch thick.</li>
        <li>Or roll out dough to the same thickness and cut circles with a cookie cutter.</li>
        <li>Fry the cakes in hot fat until they are puffy and golden. (A cast-iron skillet is ideal for this, but it must be kept heavily greased by adding oil from time to time while the cakes are frying).</li>
        <li>Drain the cakes on absorbent paper and keep them warm in the oven.</li>
